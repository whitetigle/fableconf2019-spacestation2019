## Tips
- 401 errors just mean you didn't use the good credentials or your game has not been created 
- ping does give everything you need to login (login command+user+pass)
- the space station is a series of rooms, which must be operated in order to help a safe release
- The engineer is only waiting to get a message from you to run outside
- command names are encrypted but when they fail they should help you understand how they work
